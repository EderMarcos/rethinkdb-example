##README
This is a simple voting app made with RethinkDB + Node.js, Express, EJS (as templating language), Socket.IO, and jQuery for the tutorial [Practical Introduction to RethinkDB](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/nosql-databases/a-practical-introduction-to-rethinkdb?status=in-review).

There's a lot of functionality missing, but it has been kept simple on purpose in order to show clearly the integration of RethinkDB's API and how to develop a real-time application.

To run the application:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install and start [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/)
3. Download this repository and execute `npm init` to download the dependencies.
4. Execute `npm start`. The database will be created by the application.
5. Go to http://localhost:3000 and start adding movies
